# donkhouse-coolers

I know some people were skeptical about hands played on Donkhouse. To verify if the site overall changed poker equities, I wrote some javascript code to "play" poker automatically (ie bet/call 100 preflop and check till showdown). I call this code using selenium in play_donk.ipynb. I simulated around 7k hands, while scraping them with donk_scraper.py. 

In hands_stat_analysis.ipynb, I ran some basic tests of how hand equities change from street to street. I didn't find anything out of the ordinary but I've included the simulated hand histories in the folders donk_1 - donk_8.
