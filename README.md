# donkhouse-coolers

For a look at how hand equities change look at hands_stat_analysis.ipynb.

To view hands, use view_donk_hands.ipynb

Hand histories are stored in the donk_hands folder included in this repo (sorted by table). Tables "donk_1" through "donk_8" are simulated hands.

To scrape hands run the donk_scraper.py file. It will log in, and scrape hand histories at tables with 2 or more players sitting.

To simulate your own donk hands, use the play_donk.ipynb. It runs javascript in your browser to always bet 100 or call preflop and check down flop, turn & river.
